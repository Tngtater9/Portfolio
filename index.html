					<p>
						I am an experienced mid-level React developer with strong communication skills honed through years of experience in
						sales and customer service with an interest in AI technologies. I am known for my attention to detail, efficient
						problem-solving abilities, and consistent leadership by example. With over five years of experience, I’ve built a solid
						foundation in both front-end and back-end development. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My journey began with the Thinkful Bootcamp, where I gained advanced experience in front-end technologies, including
						HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and React. I also developed backend skills by creating RESTful APIs with Node.js,
						Express, and PostgreSQL, and collaborated in an AGILE environment using Git for version control. 
					</p>
					<p>
						At Revature, I expanded my expertise in front-end development, utilizing React, React Native, and Redux. I also gained
						experience with AWS technologies, such as DynamoDB and S3 for data storage, as well as Lambda Functions and API Gateway
						to build RESTful backends. Working in a collaborative team environment, I had the opportunity to learn from others and
						grow as a developer. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I was later contracted to Cognizant, where I worked on both internal and client-facing projects. Over the last four
						years, I have worked closely with a client to develop a web tool using React and Apollo Client for the front end,
						GraphQL and Hasura for data management, and .NET 8.0 for backend processes that require more heavy lifting than the
						front-end can handle. We utilized Azure DevOps and other Azure services to manage and monitor our products and
						collaborate in an AGILE environment with various teams. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I am excited to bring my skills and experience to your team, continue learning, and contribute to impactful projects.
